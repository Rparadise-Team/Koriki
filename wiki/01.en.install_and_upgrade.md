## Fresh installation

This is the installation procedure to use the first time Koriki is installed:

1. Download the latest distribution from the [releases section of this repository](https://github.com/Rparadise-Team/Koriki/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the file downloaded in the previous step onto an empty microSD card in FAT32 format and with empty label.
3. Safely eject the microSD card from the PC (following the recommendations of our operating system).
4. Insert the microSD card into the console and turn it on.

## Upgrade

If we have a previous version of Koriki installed and we want to install a patch or update, the procedure is as follows. Before installing, check if the patch or update is suitable by following the instructions that accompany the package against the version of Koriki that you have installed at that moment, which you can see through the `System Info` application that you will find in the `Apps & Games > Apps` section.

1. Download the update package (either a patch or the full distribution) from the [releases section of this repository](https://github.com/Rparadise-Team/Koriki/releases).
2. Copy the file downloaded in the previous step to the root of the microSD card of the console.
3. Safely eject the microSD card from the PC (following the recommendations of your operating system).
4. Insert the microSD card into the console and turn it on. An image should appear on the screen describing the version of the patch or update that will be installed as well as the approximate time it will take to finish.

In case of problems with the previous procedure, we can install the patch or update manually following the same steps of the [Fresh installation](#fresh_installation) by unzipping the file on the card with Koriki already installed. For the installation to be as correct as possible, before unzipping the zip file, we will visualize the `.deletes` file that we will find in the zip file and we will manually delete the files or directories that we find there identified with their complete path.
