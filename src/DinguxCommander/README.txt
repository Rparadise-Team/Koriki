Introduction
------------

DinguxCommander is a file manager for Dingoo (Dingux).
It uses two vertical panels side by side, one being the source and the other the

or Midnight Commander.
DinguxCommander allows to:
    o Copy, move and delete multiple files.
    o View a file
    o Execute a file
    o Rename a file or directory
    o Create a new directory
    o Display disk space used by a list of selected files/dirs
    o Display disk information (used, available, total)

Installation

As usual:

o Extract the archive, keeping the directory structure
o Copy the directory 'DinguxCommander' and its contents somewhere on your SD
  card under '/boot/local' (for example: in /boot/local/apps/)
