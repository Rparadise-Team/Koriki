A STATEMENT ON LEGACY SUPPORT

In the terminal world there is much cruft that comes from old and unsup‐
ported terminals that inherit incompatible modes  and  escape  sequences
which noone is able to know, except when he/she comes from that time and
developed a graphical vt100 emulator at that time.

One  goal  of  st is to only support what is really needed. When you en‐
counter a sequence which you really need, implement it.  But  while  you
are  at it,  do not add the other cruft you might encounter while sneek‐
ing at other terminal emulators. History has bloated them and  there  is
no real evidence that most of the sequences are used today.
