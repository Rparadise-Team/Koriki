This file contains all major changes made during the development of bftpd.
The uppermost change is the newest one.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 6.1
	- Fixed linking errors on latest complilers GCC/Clang by
	  addressing variable scope.
	- Make sure we do not rely on argv or argv[0] being valid.
	  Bftpd now exits with an error if arguements are not passed as expected.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 6.0
	- Make extended passive mode respect the PASSIVE_PORTS variable
	  in the bftpd configuration file. Previously random ports
	  would be assigned.
	- Minor code clean-up in mystrings library to avoid calculating
	  string length multiple times.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.9
	- Fixed output of directory listing so that file size is right-justified
	  which makes output look cleaner.
	  Fix suggested by uomo ukko.
	- Addressed some compiler warnings. Make sure we bail out
          of situations even if they should never realisticaly return
	  an error.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.8
	- Many spelling errors in source code and documentation found and
	  fixed by Jens of Fossies (fossies.org). Applied spelling corrections.
	- Removed mark-up and special characters from COPYING, README, and INSTALL
	  files.
	- Fixed file size reporting on 32-bit ARM architecture when files are
	  large (greater than 2GB).
	  Problem and fix reported by uomo ukko.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.7
	- A malicious client could cause a buffer overflow with
	  a lot of EPSV commands sent in a row. We now close
	  the pasv socket before each new use to avoid accumulating
	  more than 1023.
	  Thanks to Shisong Qin for reporting this issue and suggesting
	  a fix.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.6
	- Fixed file transfer ratios so that an empty
	  ratio, such as one set by running Bftpd without
	  a configuration file, results in there being no
	  ratio.
        - Fixed potential string overflow issue in
          mystring.c code. Avoids situations where an
          unusually large string might be able to overwrite
          a buffer.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.5
	- Fixed a file descriptor leak would could cause the Bftpd
	  server to run out of available files it can open when storing/uploading
          files.
          Eric Debief provided a patch to correct the issue.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.4
	- Fixed potential one-by-one heap issue when
          reading during transferring files. 
	  Issue reported by Antonio Morales.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.3
	- Made the situation where FILE_AUTH more clear, advised
          against it. Added warning about making sure password
          file is not readable by another other than the admin.
	- Updated Makefile.in to use more fine-grained dependency
	  checks. Should speed up compiling when just one
	  source file has been altered.
	  New Makefile.in provided by Vemake.
	- Fixed out of bounds memory read when fetching options.
          Issue reported by and solution provided by Antonio Morales.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.2
	- Make sure we do not send extra newline when DENY message
	is sent to the client.
	- Fixed some build dependencies in the Makefile so fresh
          build is triggered by updating config.h.
          Change provided by Vemake.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.1
	- Fixed duplicate error message when user tries to
          sign in with invalid username.
	- Make sure user can change username before
	  successfully authenticating.
	- Fix error message when "type" command is not
          given a parameter.
	- Make sure we do not return multiple error
	  codes when an account is disabled.
	- Do not drop connection to client when
	  selected account is disabled.
	- Make sure when accounts are disabled/denied, they print the
          proper reason (set in the config file) back to the client.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 5.0
	- Added more checks to places where we are mapping a file
          or checking for symbolic links. Should avoid trying to
          operating on invalid path names or broken symlinks.
          Issue reported by Xu.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.9
	- Several checks added to chdir() and other
          return codes to make sure syscalls are all returning
          properly. Patch provided by Zhouyang Jia.
	- Fixed some compiler warnings due to unused or
          oddly indented code.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.8
	- Fixed potential double-free bug during Bftpd shutdown.
	- Fixed potential unititalized variable.
	  Thanks to Alex for reporting these bugs.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.7
	- Fixed memory leak in rename function.
          Thanks to Alex for reporting this bug.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.6
	- Avoid memory corruption when reading config file by initializing memory.
	- Make sure CHROOT is default option, even if it is not specified
	  in the config file.
	  Thanks for Anton Yuzhaninov for providing the above two fixes.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.5
	- Avoid potential buffer underflow in main.c
	  Thanks to Andreas for pointing out this problem.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.4
	- Fixed potential buffer overflow when
	  expanding symbolic link file names.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.3
	- Clarified license (COPYING file)
        - Fixed compiler warning with regards to
          pointer-to-integer cast.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.2
	- Improved user checking code to avoid locking out
	  valid users from the system.
	  (Thanks to Lauri Kasanen for reporting this bug
           and supplying a patch.)
	
Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.1
	- Added checks to crypt() calls to prevent
	  operating on NULL pointer.
	  (Thanks to Lauri Kasanen for reporting this bug.)

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 4.0
	- Added patch from Thomas Cort to make Bftpd
	  compile on NetBSD.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.9
	- Adjusted Makefile to allow for easy access to
	  non-default compiler options. Alternative compiler
	  can be used by running "make CC=compilername".
	- Zhenbo Xu reported several potential memory
	  bugs which could cause Bftpd if the operating
	  system is out of memory. Also reported a memory
          leak. Checks are now in place to prevent crashes
	  and the memory leak has been plugged.
	- Added MINIX-specific configuration file which
          should allow Bftpd to run smoothly and without
	  additional configuration on MINIX.
	- Merged MINIX porting code into mainline Bftpd
	  so we can work with one, unified code base.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.8
	- Fixed bug in user tracking which could result
          in corrupted times on 64-bit systems.
	- When Bftpd is compiled with a "prefix" (which
          is the default behaviour) the Bftpd will
	  check both /etc/bftpd.conf AND PREFIX/etc/bftpd.conf
          when trying to find its configuration file.
          This should avoid requiring the admin to pass
	  the location of the config file on the command line.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.7
	- Removed CVS directory from doc folder.
	- Options in the config file may now have
          following #comments.
          Reading the config file should happen a
          little faster too.
          Thanks to Zhang for reporting this issue.
	- Fixed typo in re-reading config file.
	  Thanks to Zhang for reporting this issue.
	- When installing Bftpd the make file now
	  respects the configure --prefix=/path/to/install
	  flag.
          Thanks to Martin for reporting this bug.
        - Config file parser now handled multiple
          unexpected spaces.
          Thanks to Chang for reporting this issue.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.6
	- Expanded home directory maximum length to 64 characters.
	- Directory listing no longer hangs if the directory
	  contains a named pipe.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.5
	- Added explicit setting of sin_family to AF_INET to
	  avoid ambiguity and possible bind errors.
	  (Patch provided by Tony.)

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.4
	- Added configuration file option TIMEZONE_FIX. By
	  default Bftpd tries to guess the time zone, working
	  around the C library. When running on a system where
	  the C library can correctly guess the time zone in
	  a chroot environment, set TIMEZONE_FIX="no" in the
	  bftpd.conf file.
	- Added -v command line option which will cause
	  Bftpd to display the current version and exit.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.3
	- Time stamps in the log file were not correct
	  after chrooting. Added time zone code to make
	  sure we can calculate the correct time without
	  access to system time zone info.
	  (Thanks to Paul for reporting this bug.)
	  

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.2
	- Added new value for SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES option in the
  	  config file. The option can now be set to "yes",
 	  "no" or "always". This allows admins to determine whether
	  clients can see hidden files if it is requested, never
	  or all the time, respectively. Please see the config file
	  comments for details.
	- Made sure HIDE_GROUP variable will cause files belonging
	  to a given group to not be shown to the client.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.1
	- Make sure default config disables anonymous login
	  by default.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 3.0
	- Updated documentation to fix links. Thanks to Xiang for
	  pointing out the error.
	- Added Slovak documentation, provided by Dusan.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.9
	- Bftpd will attempt to create it's utmp directory
          if that directory does not exist. Fixes issue on
	  Ubuntu where the directory is wiped out at each
	  reboot.
	- The ROOTDIR option now works properly for
	  anonymous users.
	  Thanks to Paul for reporting this bug.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.8
	- Added patch which will allow client to see hidden
	  files if the "-a" parameter is used in list commands. 
	  Hidden files are only shown if SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES 
	  is enabled in the config file.
	  Patch provided by Raster.
	- Swapped out glob function for custom directory
  	  search matching. Allows clients to see broken
	  symbolic links if "SHOW_NONREADABLE_FILES" is set
	  to "yes".
	  Patch supplied by Raster.
	- Added patch to clean up zombies if several children
	  processes all die at the same time. We were cleaning up
	  just one child per signal before.
	  Patch supplied by Raster.
	- Fixed typo in log error message.
	- Made sure we can read user config file options
	  even with unusual compile flags.
	- Fixed anonymous login.
	- Anonymous login disabled by default in the config file.



Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.7
	- Added patch from Raster which returns more speicifc error
	  messages to the client when a file or directory cannot be
	  removed. This should avoid confusing some clients when the
	  user attempts to remove a directory.
	- Added checks for increased security/stability and to remove
	  compiler warnings.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.6
	- Removed some debugging information from the log file.
	- Made certain that bandwidth log will not over-write itself
       	  when multiple users are logged in.
	- Bandwidth log file is flushed to avoid loss of data.
 	- Bftpd will write to bandwidth log even if client does
	  not disconnect cleanly.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.5
	- Added better UTF support. Clients that check for this
  	  will now enable UTF-8. For example, Filezilla.
	- Made sure remote admin login was disabled. This shouldn't
  	  have worked anyway, but disabled the feature to make sure.
	- Added additional log file which tracks user bandwidth.
	  See the option in the config file called BANDWIDTH.
	- Updated README file to contain notes on logging.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.4
	- Fixed a possible security hole which would allow
	attackers to perform a DoS attack against bftpd.
        (Thanks to Dazhi for pointing out this problem.)


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.2.1 (aka 2.3)
	- Bftpd should not attempt to close stdin, stdout and stderr
	if they do not exist. Fixed this in main.c.
	(Patch provided by Ivan A-R.)


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.2
	- Bftpd does not exit when an incorrect password is given.
	The server does drop connections in cases where logins are
	specifically denied, full server or if an error appears in
	the config file.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.1.2
	- Added option to not show files in a dir list
	if the file is not readable. Thanks to Eric
        Woltermann for sending in this patch.
	By default non-readable files are not listed.
	See the SHOW_NONREADABLE_FILES config option.
	- Make the replace() function safer with
	range checking to avoid buffer over-flow.
	- Fixed calls to replace() function.
	- Most string buffers now have a set size of
	MAX_STRING_LENGTH, rather than some arbitrary size.
	- Applied patch to allow user specific data to
	be substituted into the user MOTD file path.
	The symbols %u and %h and be used in place of the
	user's username and home directory in the MOTD_USER
	config option.
	Thanks to Eric Woltermann for submitting this patch.
	- Bftpd now prompts for a password, even on anonymous
	accounts to help increase compatibility with some
	web browsers.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.1.1
	- Fixed directory creation so that the proper
	umask is used. thanks to Thiemo for pointing
	out this problem.
	- Fixed buffer under-size error in options.c
	Thanks to Athan for reporting this bug.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.1
	- By default, the SITE command is now disabled
	in the bftpd.conf file. This is to prevent
	security holes and DoS attacks via "site md5 <filename>"

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.0.3
	- Added md5 support for amd64 machines.
	- If no arch is defined for md5, assume little endian.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.0.2
	- Transfer buffer size now defaults to staying the
	same (max) size for all transfers. To get a variable
	buffer size, change the config option CHANGE_BUFSIZE
	to "yes".
	- Added config file option SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES. When this
	option is set to "yes", bftpd shows hidden files in directory
	listings. By default this is set to "no".


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.0.1
	- Avoid possible segfault in replace() function
	in mystring.c
	- Avoid memory error in main.c using strdup()
	- Avoid segfault in options.c the create_options()
	- Added ability to use the SITE command to provide md5
	checksums of files. (usage: site md5 filename)

	Very many thanks to Ulrich Drepper and Gray Watson for
	the md5 library!

	- Changed ratio calculations to use double type to
	allow for larger files and data transfers.
	- Added HELP option to the SITE command.
	(usage: site help)
	- Added config file variable CHANGE_BUFSIZE. This
          determines whether the transfer buffer changes size.
          It defaults to "yes".
	- Removed extra fileno() calls in file receives.



Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 2.0
	- Avoid memory error in options.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.9.3
	- Avoid segfaults in options.c and cwd.c
	- Added memory checks in options.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.9.2
	- Avoid segfaults in options.c and dirlist.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.9.1
	- Avoid segfaults in options.c and main.c
	
Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.9
	- Added limits.h entry to main.c and options.c
	for compatibility with FreeBSD.
	(All problems with bftpd on FreeBSD were found and 
	corrected by Beech of the FreeBSD team.)

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.4
	- When printing file sizes for files larger than 4GB
	the file size is now displayed correctly.
	- When a FTP client drops a connection without sending
	an ABORT (ABOR) signal, Bftpd will detect the dropped
	connection and log it. This prevents stale connections
	preventing new users from connecting.
	(Bug found and fixed by: Thorsten)
	- Added limits.h and signal.h to list of headers used
	in commands.c, for compatibility with BSD.
	- Changed sighandler_t in "run_script()" to sig_t
	for compatibility between Linux and BSD.
	- Added OpenPAM patch from FreeBSD (login.c)
	- Added limits.h include to login.c file for
	compatibility with BSD.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.3
	- If Bftpd is unable to create bftpdutmp file, an error
	should now be written to the log file.
	- Directory output corrected for when large files (> 2GB)
	are listed.
	- Documentation for xinetd config updated.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.2
	- Changed bftpd's directory name to plain "bftpd"
	rather than "bftpd-version". This will, hopefully, make
	it easier to run scripts which build/run bftpd.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.8.1
	- Avoid segfault in getoption() (options.c)
	  Credit to Mats Erik Andersson for finding this bug.
	- Fixed potential memory leaks in commands.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.7.2
	- Fixed serious bug which would cause bftpd to crash
	while sending a file. Double-free error.
	(Credit to Davide Pozza for reporting these bugs below.)
	- Prevent buffer over-flow in parsecmd() when
	forming confstr variable.
	- Check return values of strtoul() to make sure they
	do not over-flow an int.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.7.1
	(Credit to Davide Pozza for reporting these bugs.)
	- Avoid memory over-flow in bftpd_login (login.c)
	with the str[] variable. Made size 512 + 1.
	- Avoid buffer over-flow in str[] variable in
	main().
	- Prevent buffer over-flow in check_file_password()
	when performing fscanf().
	- In check_file_password() made calloc() allocate
	larger buffer to prevent over-flow.
	- Performed range checking on the number of users on
	the system to make sure they don't over-flow a 32-bit int.
	- Make sure malloc calls in commands.c do not allocate
	too much or too little memory.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.6
	- Perform memory allocation check in bftpd_cwd_mappath()
	- Changed a strcmp() to strcasecmp() in command_retr function.
	- Performed free(mapped) at end of command_retr.
	- Performed memory checks and clean-up in various functions.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.5
	- The when using the FILE_AUTH option, the text
	password file can contain anonymous users. That is,
	users who do not require passwords. THIS IS DANGEROUS
	ON MOST SYSTEMS. A entry with the password field set to
	a * (star) does not require a password. See the
	config file option FILE_AUTH for more information.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.4
	- Allow ANONYMOUS_USER config file option to be used with
	the FILE_AUTH option. This basically allows anyone
	to login to the system without a password if both
	options are used!
	- When a chroot fails during login the server will
	no longer tell the client which directory it was trying
	to chroot to.
	- When the config.h file contains a definition for
	NO_GETPWNAM then the getpwnam() function is not used.
	Also, this forces the use of the FILE_AUTH option. If
	NO_GETPWNAM is defined and FILE_AUTH is not used, all
	connections are dropped.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.3
	- Introduced option to over-ride the local/LAN
	IP address assigned to the host computer. This
	option takes a 4-number IP address in the format
	of "127.0.3.101". See OVERRIDE_IP in bftpd.conf for
	more information.
	- Removed description-pak file from source tree.
	- The options PRE_WRITE_SCRIPT and POST_WRITE_SCRIPT
	have been added to the bftpd.conf file. These options
	let you run scripts before and after any command writes
	to the file system. Handy if you want to re-mount.
	Please see the bftpd.conf file for details.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.2
	- When using FILE_AUTH to login, check
	DO_CHROOT option before performing
	a chroot().

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6.1
	- Removed code which uses sendfile().
	The sendfile code appears to cause a
	conflict on some systems when used
	with 64-bit file size variables.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.6
	- Released bftpd without code changes, but
	with updated Polish documentation.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.5
	- Added Polish documentation to website.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.4.1
	- Added ability to use a plain text file
	  for authentication. See config file option
	  FILE_AUTH for details.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.4
	- Fixed default configuration.
	- Fixed compile warnings for vanilla config.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.3.2
	- Fixed Makefile to erase config.cache file during
	  "make clean"
	- Added ability to uncompress files on the fly
	  during downloads. Any file with the extension
	  ".gz" can be decompressed during transfer to
	  the client with the use of the GZ_DOWNLOAD
	  in the config file. This option requires bftpd
	  be configured (pre-compile time) with the flag
	  --enable-libz.


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.3.1
	- Changed ratio values to unsigned long
	  variables to support large files.
	- Edited Makefile to allow bftpd to handle large
	  files (2GB+).

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.2.2
	- Added ability to upload files and
	  compress them into .gz files on the fly.
	  See bftpd.conf file for the option.
	  This option requires --enable-libz be
	  used when running the configure script.

	- Cleaned up code to avoid compiler warnings
	  from gcc 4.0.2.
	  Files changed: main.c commands.c

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.2.1
	- When the config file is re-read, global
          are changed only.   
          Files changes: options.c options.h


Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.2
	- Made re-reable options be able to hold larger
	  values. Up to 256 bytes/characters long.
	- Replaced old rpm spec file with one from
	  Joe, which will be used from now on for
	  rpm builds.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.1.3
	- When a child/client dies, the
	  parent process will now attempt to
	  remove the client's log entry
	  from the bftpdutmp file. This
	  should prevent stale entries.
	- Changed some default values to
          constants in options.h
	- Fixed typo(s) in bftpd.conf
	- Set delete/over-write for global
	  users to be disabled by default
          in bftpd.conf.
        - Added the XFER_DELAY option to
          the bftpd.conf file. This allows
          the admin to set a time delay
          between data transfer bursts.
          This aid in bandwidth throttling.
          Please see bftpd.conf for more
          details on this feature.
	- Added more re-read options
          when catching signal SIGHUP.
          The re-readable options are now:
          HELLO_STRING, QUIT_MSG, XFERBUFSIZE,
          DATA_TIMEOUT, CONTROL_TIMEOUT,
          USERLIMIT_GLOBAL, USERLIMIT_SINGLEUSER,
          USERLIMIT_HOST, DENY_LOGIN and XFER_DELAY.

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.1.2
	- Program now catches signal SIGHUP.
	- When bftpd catches the SIGHUP (hang up)
          it re-reads the config file. It looks
          for some config values, but not all.
          At this time, the values which are
          re-read are:
          HELLO_STRING, QUIT_MSG and XFERBUFSIZE

Jesse Smith <jessefrgsmith@yahoo.ca> -> 1.1.1
	- Added rpm spec file to redhat directory.
	- Changed numeric string length (512) to a defined
          string length (MAXCMD). Makes code more
          compatible with main.c and uses less stack
          memory. File changed: commands.c
	- When receiving files, the transfer buffer
          (XFER_BUFSIZE) is divided by the number of 
          connected clients. This should prevent bandwidth
          being sucked back by multiple connections.
	- Minor fixes, checking for malloc errors,
          freeing memory and closing sockets.
          File changed: commands.c
        - When sending files, the transfer buffer
          (XFER_BUFSIZE) is divided by the number
          of connected clients. This should prevent
          bandwidth being taken over by multiple connections.
	- Changed Makefile so bftpd.8 gets installed as
	  a manual page in the proper location.
          Also updated rpm spec file to include man page.


Jesse Smith <slicer69@hotmail.com> -> 1.1.0
	- Changed some bftpdutmp_log(0) lines to
	calls to bftpdutmp_end(). This should be safer.	
	- Made sure that clients cannot write or append
	to files if the "delete" command is disabled. I
	think if they cannot delete the file they shouldn't
	be allowed to truncate it to zero bytes either.
	- Added reason for login failure to log file.
	- Removed logging of getting user count from
	temp file. Just seems to be taking up space.

Jesse Smith <slicer69@hotmail.com> -> 1.0.24-2
	- Added ability to block multiple connections from the
	  same IP address. This will keep download managers and
	  Internet Explorer from taking up multiple connections.
          See the new option USERLIMIT_HOST in bftpd.conf.
	- Made sure that bftpd logs out stale control connections
	  via added calls to bftpdutmp_log(0).
	- Added alarm() calls before trying to read from
	  the control socket. We shouldn't assume we are going to
	  get anything.

Jesse Smith <slicer69@hotmail.com> -> 1.0.24-1
	- Fixed bug with NLIST command. The bftpd server should not be
	  sending leading path in front of filename when using NLIST.
	  File(s) affected: dirlist.c
	- Added the MGET command. Allows client to receive multiple files
	  with one command.
	  File(s) affected: commands.c
	- Added the MPUT command. Allows client to send multiple files
	  to the server with one command.
	  File(s) affected: commands.c

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.24
	- The PATH_BFTPDUTMP configuration option was added (idea by Szabo Peter
	  <pts@math.bme.hu>).
	- Whenever a data connection is established, the reply message now
	  contains the transfer mode (idea by Szabo Peter).
	- The -D, -h and -n command line options have been added (idea by Szabo
	  Peter). Some code was changed to support operation without a configuration
	  file.
	- ATTENTION! The option LOGFILE has changed. See sample config file.
	- In daemon mode, bftpd closes its sockets correctly now (important if you
	  have a lot of connections), problem discovered by Olivier Kaloudoff.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented Mozilla from getting directory lists (found
	  by Marc Pauls).
	- Daniel Mack fixed a memory leak in his code.
	- The configuration parser handles comments better now.
	- The USERLIMIT_GLOBAL configuration option has been added.
	- The USERLIMIT_SINGLEUSER configuration option has been added.
	- Some memory leaks discovered by David Heine <dlheine@suif.stanford.edu>
	  were fixed.

      reported by Saus101 <Saus101@prime.gushi.org>).
    - A bug in the HELP function was fixed.
    - Two BSD incompatibilities have been fixed.
    - A STAT bug was fixed.

    - The DATA_TIMEOUT configuration option has been added.
    - The PASSIVE_PORTS configuration option has been added.
    - A control timeout bug has been fixed.
    - Configuration options are now written like name="value", allowing
      comments after the option. Directories are written like
      directory "/foo/bar" {. Please update your config files!
    - bftpdutmp logging has been implemented as well as some administration
      functions using it. Read the updated documentation for details on how
      to use them.
    - You needn't link gzip statically to bftpd any more if you want on-the-fly
      compression, but you can dynamically link against zlib instead now.
      The pax sources are still needed for tar on-the-fly.
    - A directory listing bug reported by Hendrik Harms
      <hendrik.harms@bigfoot.de> has been fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.21
    - The XFER_BUFSIZE configuration option has been added, allowing tweaking
      of data throughput. If you and your clients are on a very fast network
      (fast meaning 100 Mbit/s or more), you should set this to 64000 or
      something like that.
    - The APPE command has been implemented.
    - The ALLO command has been implemented as an alias to NOOP.
    - The INITAL_CHROOT configuration option has been added. See the new
      example config file for details.
    - The ability to disable logging has been added :)
    - A bug making file transmissions impossible with old config files has
      been fixed.
    - A bug concerning file truncating when STORing has been fixed.

    - The FEAT function has been implemented.
    - A permission bug in the STOR function has been fixed.

    - The EPSV and EPRT functions have been implemented, making IPv6 support
      possible somewhere in the future.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.19
    - The NLST function has been made usable again. There has been an
      unnoticed bug in it since the globbing function has been implemented.
    - The XCWD, XCUP, XMKD, XRMD and XPWD functions have been implemented
      as aliases to CWD, CDUP, MKD, RMD and PWD.
    - The documentation is now in the SGML format, making it more extensible,
      hopefully.
    - The DATAPORT20 configuration option has been added. If set to yes,
      the server will open data connections from port 20, which should make
      firewall users happier.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.18
    - The configuration file has been restructured. See README for details.
    - The PORT configuration option has been added, allowing you to change
      the port number the daemon should listen on (only for daemon mode).
    - A workaround for the /*/../* vulnerability mentioned on Bugtraq has
      been added, although it's not the right thing to do, really.
    - Compatibility to Solaris 8 has been improved. Josh Woodcock
      <josh@hamparts.com> and Michael Smirnov <smb@mh.vstu.edu.ru> gave
      some hints.
    - The CONTROL_TIMEOUT configuration option has been added. You can now
      say after how many seconds of idle time users should be kicked.
    - Hashes (#) in /etc/passwd and /etc/group are now supported as comments.
      This improves FreeBSD compatibility, I'm not sure about other systems.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.17
	- A globbing bug was fixed, making Midnight Commander able to connect
	  to bftpd.
    - A bug which appeared when doing LIST if a group line in /etc/group
      had more than 256 characters was fixed.
    - /etc/shells and /etc/ftpusers authentication were implemented by
      Christophe Bailleux.
    - You can now indent your configuration options with tabulators.
    - A small problem with the ip_conntrack_ftp kernel module has been fixed,
      which was the fault of ip_conntrack_ftp. It was found by Erik Hensema
      <erik@hensema.xs4all.nl>.
    - ASCII transfer mode has been implemented.
    - You can now prevent a user from executing specific commands by using
      the ALLOWCOMMAND_XXXX=no option.

	  to the client, so that an attacker can't make the server connect
	  to a machine in its LAN.

	  fixed.
	- A bug making the server crash when logging in a non-existent user
	  with ANONYMOUS_USER enabled was fixed.

	  following:
	    - Spaces after a command in each command string are removed.
	    - The HELP command was implemented.
	    - CWD to ~ now works.
	  
Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.15
	- You can override the default path to the config file with the command
	  line parameter '-c'.
	- wtmp logging was implemented, so that bftpd logins show up in
	  commands like 'last'.
	- You can have bftpd bind to only one interface, for example, if you
	  want to run an FTP proxy server on the same port on another network
	  interface.
	- The LIST and NLST commands now support globbing.
	- A security problem in the syslog code was fixed.
