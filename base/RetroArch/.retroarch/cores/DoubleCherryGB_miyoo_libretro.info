description = "A fork of the TGB Dual Game Boy core with added DMG07(4-Player-Adapter) emulation. 
While this core is a decent, usable emulator, it is most notable for being able to emulate to Game Boys connected via Link Cable, which is useful for things like trading Pokemon, etc. 
DoubleCherryGB added the emulation of the GAMEBOY 4 PLAYER ADATPTER (DMG-07) and 4Player Link Hacks like the Tetris 4Player Hack. 

For now it's the 4 Player features are not ready for netplay.

Thanks to the core's modest hardware requirements, it should run well even on low-powered hardware, though users with more powerful hardware may be better served by the SameBoy core, which can also do the same Link Cable functionality but with improved accuracy and compatibility."
