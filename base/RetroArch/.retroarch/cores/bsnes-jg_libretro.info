description = "bsnes-jg is a fork of bsnes v115, rewritten to use the C++ standard library and focus on preservation through accurate emulation and a robust, standards-compliant codebase. Speed hacks were removed, and support for achievements and libretro's cheat interface were added. Additionally, higher quality audio resampling, as well as full support for Super Game Boy, BS-X Satellaview, Sufami Turbo, and Competition carts has been implemented. This core is slightly faster than the original bsnes, but still has more or less the same system requirements. It is a great option for desktop platforms with relatively fast CPUs, though it will also run at full speed on a number of ARM SBCs.
